# Hanuman Chatbot

### Project Title: Hanuman Chatbot 🚩

**Hanuman Chatbot** is a devotional AI-based chatbot inspired by the teachings, strength, wisdom, and devotion of **Lord Hanuman**. The chatbot is designed to provide spiritual guidance and motivational responses through an interactive chat interface.

The project focuses on combining a modern web-based user interface with a Python backend to simulate an intelligent conversational assistant.

### Technology Stack Used

**Frontend Technologies:**

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* CSS / UI Components

**Backend Technologies:**

* Python
* Flask
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based logic
* REST API integration

### Project Structure (Frontend)

The frontend follows a clean and modular structure for maintainability and scalability:

```
hanuman-chatbot/

├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── lib/
│
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Execution and Running Details (Frontend)

To run the frontend of the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RGTrigger/hanuman-chatbot.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd hanuman-chatbot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the application in a browser at:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Backend Integration

The frontend communicates with a **Flask-based backend API** that is responsible for generating chatbot responses.
The backend handles all AI-related logic using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and runs as a separate service.

This separation ensures:

* Better scalability
* Clean architecture
* Easier debugging and maintenance

---

### Purpose of the Project

This project was developed as part of my learning process to gain practical experience in:

* Modern frontend development using React and TypeScript
* API-based system design
* Integration of AI-powered backends with web interfaces
* Clean project structuring and version control using GitHub
